# jss-sandbox
I am a Sitecore and JavaScript developer who is currently learning the Sitecore JavaScript Services (JSS) SDK. My goal is to build a small sandbox site where I can explore JSS features and try out the API. I want to take typical challenges that developers encounter on projects and explore how they are handled in the JSS world.

## Goal
The purpose of this repo is to track progress, and to share my learnings with the community. For every topic that I explore, I will write a blog post describing what I did and what I learned.

## Contributing
All Sitecore community members are welcome to contribute to and experiment in this sandbox via pull requests, topic suggestions, or general feedback. If there’s a feature you’re been wanting to try in JSS - go for it!
